## How to Contribute

1. **Branch Management (Branching Strategy)**
   - The `master` (or `main`) branch should always contain a stable version of the project.
   - For developing new features or modifying existing content, create a new branch (e.g., `Analysis_development`) from the latest `master` code. Once development is complete, merge your branch back via a pull request, ensuring each change is well-documented.

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Provide concise and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes being made. For example:
     - `Added cleaned survey data and initial analysis scripts`
     - `Refined interview protocol and updated consent form template`
   - Clear commit messages help track the project’s progress and understand the rationale behind each change.

3. **Issue Tracking**
   - Utilize GitHub Issues to track to-do tasks, bugs, or improvements. Create and assign issues (e.g., “Complete data cleaning for surveys”) to the appropriate team members.

4. **Pull Requests & Code Reviews**
   - Once a branch is ready for review, submit a pull request and notify the team for review. Only merge changes after approval to maintain high quality and consistency.

## Naming Conventions

- **File Naming**
  - We recommend using the following format for files:  
    ```
    [YYYY-MM-DD]_[Brief_Description]_[Version].[FileExtension]
    ```  
    For example:
    - `2025-04-01_SurveyRawData_v1.xlsx`
    - `2025-04-05_FocusGroup_Photo1.jpg`
  
- **Folder Naming**
  - Folders are named based on the research phase or content type (e.g., `Literature_Review`, `Qualitative_Analysis`), ensuring clarity and preventing overlap.

## Technologies Used

- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and collaboration, ensuring that all changes are tracked and team members can work seamlessly.
- **Python** (or **R**) – For data analysis and visualization.
- **Office Suites / Google Docs** – Used for creating reports, documentation, and other textual data.
